I'm Derrick Futschik, better known as Derrops. I'm Head of Engineering in a small, but rapidly growing start-up called [Fortiro](https://fortiro.com). As you may have guessed, I'm into Devops. My cloud of choice is AWS. I've been meaning to start blogging for years, but now I've finally decided to have the descipline to do it.
