I'm Derrick Futschik, but known in the industry as Derrops ðŸ˜‰. I'm Head of Engineering in a small, but rapidly growing start-up called [Fortiro](https://fortiro.com). As you may have guessed, I'm into Devops. My cloud of choice is AWS. This is my Blog on all things Devops, with examples done in AWS, although they are applicable to other clouds.
